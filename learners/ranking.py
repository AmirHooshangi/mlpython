The ``learners.ranking`` module contains learners meant for ranking problems. 
The MLProblems for these learners should be iterators over 
triplets (input,target,query), where input is a list of
document representations and target is a list of associated 
relevance scores for the given query.

The currently implemented algorithms are:

* RankingFromClassifier:  a ranking model based on a classifier.
* RankingFromRegression:  a ranking model based on a regression model.
* ListNet:                ListNet ranking model.

class RankingFromClassifier(Learner):
    """ 
    A ranking model based on a classifier.
 
    This learner trains a given classifier to 
    predict the target relevance score associated to each
    document/query pairs found in the training set.
    
    The classifier can be used for ranking based on three
    measures, specified by option ``ranking_measure``: 

    * ``ranking_measure='predicted_score':``
      the predicted relevance score is used (first output 
      of classifier);
    * ``ranking_measure='expected_score':``
      the distribution over scores (second output) is
      used to computed the expected score, and a ranking
      is determined by sorting those expectations;
    * ``ranking_measure='expected_persistence':``
      the distribution over scores is used to determine
      the expected persistence (``(2**score-1)/max_score``).
      Ranking according to this measure should work well
      for the ERR ranking error.

    To use ``ranking_measure='predicted_score'`` as the ranking
    measure, the classifier can have only one output, i.e. the
    predicted score.  To use the other two ranking measures, the
    classifier must also output a distribution over possible relevance
    scores as the second output.

    Option ``merge_document_and_query`` should be a 
    callable function that takes two arguments (the 
    input document and the query) and outputs a 
    merged representation for the pair which will
    be fed to the classifier. By default, it is assumed
    that the document representation already contains
    query information, and only the document the input
    document is returned.
