To use milk through mlpython, do the following:

1. download milk from here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/milk/#downloads
2. install milk (instructions from their file INSTALL.rst)
   The following should work::
       python setup.py install
   A C++ compiler is required. On Windows, you might need to specify the compiler.
   For example::
       python setup.py install --compiler=mingw32
   If you have mingw installed.

3. **IMPORTANT** You have to change directory before testing milk.

And that should do it! Try 'import milk' to see if your installation is working.
