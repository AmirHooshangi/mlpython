    Decision Tree Classifier using Milk library
 
    A decision tree classifier (currently, implements the greedy ID3
    algorithm without any pruning).

    Option ``criterion`` should be a string. Set it to
    ``'information_gain'``, to use the information gain splitting
    criterion (see
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_gain_in_decision_trees),
    or to ``'z1_loss'`` to use the 0-1 classification accuracy as the
    splitting criterion (default: ``'information_gain'``).

    Option ``min_split`` is a threshold, such that a node will not be
    split further if it has less than ``min_split`` examples in it
    (default: 4).

    If option ``include_entropy`` is True, the information gain criterion will
    include the original entropy (default: False).

    **Required metadata:**

    * ``'targets'``
    * ``'class_to_id'``

    **TODO:**

    * Support Milk's options ``R`` and ``subsample`` to support random sampling of splitting decisions.
