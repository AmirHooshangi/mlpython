The package ``learners.third_party.treelearn`` contains modules for learning
algorithms implemented by in the TreeLearn library. These modules all require that the
TreeLearn and scikits-learn libraries be installed.

To install scikits-learn, one option is to use easy_install: ::

   easy_install -U scikit-learn

For other ways of installing scikits-learn, see http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/dev/install.html#installing-an-official-release.

To install TreeLearn:

1. download TreeLearn through this link: https://github.com/capitalk/treelearn/zipball/master
2. unzip the downloaded content and configure PYTHONPATH so that it is accessible through Python

One option for where to put the TreeLearn files is in
learners/third_party/treelearn/, which will ensure that the correct
modules will be imported by the	MLPython modules there.

And that should do it!

Currently, ``learner.third_party.treelearn`` contains the following modules:

* ``learning.third_party.treelearn.classification``:    Classifiers from the TreeLearn library.
