To use MLPython's interface with the TreeLearn library, you'll need to
install the TreeLearn and scikits-learn libraries. Also note that
TreeLearn requires Python 2.7 or later.

To install scikits-learn, one option is to use easy_install: ::

   easy_install -U scikit-learn

For other ways of installing scikits-learn, see http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/dev/install.html#installing-an-official-release.

To install TreeLearn:

1. download TreeLearn through this link: https://github.com/capitalk/treelearn/zipball/master
2. unzip the downloaded content and run (possibly with sudo): ::

    python setup.py install

And that should do it!
