To use libsvm through mlpython, do the following:

1. download libsvm from here: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/
2. install libsvm (see libsvm instructions)
3. install the included python interface (see libsvm intrusctions)
4. put path to the python interface in PYTHONPATH

And that should do it! Try 'python test.py' to see if your installation is working.

Here is an example of what steps 1 to 3 can look like, where LIBSVMDIR
is the path where you wish to install libsvm and
PYTHON_INCLUDEDIR is the path of your python include directory
(use at your own risk!) :

tcsh
set LIBSVMDIR=~/python
set PYTHON_INCLUDEDIR=/usr/include/python2.5
wget -O $LIBSVMDIR/libsvm-2.9.zip http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/libsvm-2.9.zip
cd $LIBSVMDIR/
unzip libsvm-2.9.zip
cd libsvm-2.9
make
cd python
make PYTHON_INCLUDEDIR=$PYTHON_INCLUDEDIR all
exit

Finally, you'll need to add $MLIBSVMDIR/python to your PYTHONPATH.
