To add unittest for a downlodable dataset, there is 2 parts. 
See the last part if the dataset you wnat to add test for is not downloadable.

1. Create a pickle file using the pickclegenerator.py that is located in mlpython/scripts/
    - The dataset must be in the dataset repository (environment variable) for the script to work.
    - The script must be run from the mlpython repository (so the pkl file will be place at the right spot)

    Use command (from mlpython directory)
    python ./scripts/picklegenerator.py DATASETNAME


2. Generate the test class with generatorPythonUnitTest.py that is located in mlpython/unit_tests/test_datasets/

- The script must be run from the mlpython repository (test file will be place at the right spot)

Use command
python ./unit_tests/test_datasets/generatorPythonUnitTest.py DATASETNAME



If the Dataset is not downloadable, you can still run the same command for the pickclegenerator
    For the generatorPythonUnitTest you will need to edit it so it won't try to download it and won't delete it after the test.
