The package ``learners.third_party.milk`` contains modules for learning
algorithms using the Milk library. These modules all require that the
Milk library be installed.

To use milk through mlpython, do the following:

1. download milk from here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/milk/#downloads
2. install milk (instructions from Milk's INSTALL.rst)
   The following should work: 
      python setup.py install
3. **IMPORTANT** When importing milk for the first time, make sure not to be in its directory.

And that should do it! Try 'import milk' to see if your installation is working.
