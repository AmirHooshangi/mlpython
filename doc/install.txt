Installation Instructions
=========================

Getting MLPython
----------------

MLPython is developed under Mercurial. To download it, simply do the
following, in the directory where you wish to put it: ::

    hg clone ssh@hg...

To learn more about Mercurial, see FILL_ME!

Installing MLPython
-------------------

Your copy of MLPython in hand, you must now do the following steps before 
you can use it:

* You must add the path to your copy of MLPython in your
  PYTHONPATH. Say the path is $HOME/python/mlpython and you are using
  a bash shell, simply add the following line to your .bashrc file: ::

   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/python/mlpython

* MLPython also uses the environment variable MLPYTHON_DATASET_REPO as
  the path where to download machine learning datasets. Simply create
  once a directory at your preferred location ::

   mkdir $HOME/ml_datasets

  and set MLPYTHON_DATASET_REPO to the path of that directory in your 
  shell configuration file: ::
   
   export MLPYTHON_DATASET_REPO=$HOME/ml_datasets

* MLPython contains some C code that needs to be compiled. On Unix systems,
  simply type ``make``Â in the root directory of MLPython: ::

   cd $HOME/python/mlpython
   make

You should now be able to use MLPython! 

Required libraries
------------------

MLPython requires a few, fairly standard scientific computing libraries:

* `BLAS <http://FILL_ME>`_:       FILL ME
* `LAPACK <http://FILL_ME>`_:     FILL ME
* `Numpy <http://FILL_ME>`_:      FILL ME
* `Matplotlib <http://FILL_ME>`_: FILL ME

These libraries are common enough that they might already be installed
on your computer.

MLPython also interfaces some third-party softwares, though they are
not necessary to use MLPython in general:

* `LIBSVM <http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/>`_: SVM classifier, see mlpython/learners/third_party/libsvm/README for instructions.
* `t-SNE <http://http://homepage.tudelft.nl/19j49/t-SNE.html>`_: t-SNE dimensionality reduction, see mlpython/misc/third_party/tsne/README for instructions.
