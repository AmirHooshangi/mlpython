To add unittest for a downlodable dataset, there is 2 parts.

1. Create a pickle file using the pickclegenerator.py that is located in mlpython/scripts/
    - The dataset must be in the dataset repository (environment variable) for the script to work.
    - The script must be run from the mlpython repository (so the pkl file will be place at the right spot)

    Use command (from mlpython directory)
    python ./scripts/picklegenerator.py DATASETNAME

    to create the pkl



2. Generate the test class with generatorPythonUnitTest.py that is located in mlpython/unit_tests/test_datasets/

- The script must be run from the mlpython repository (test file will be place at the right spot)

Use command
python ./unit_tests/test_datasets/generatorPythonUnitTest.py DATASETNAME

It should be good run.
