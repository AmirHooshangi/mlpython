Module ``misc.visualize`` includes useful functions 
for visualizing datasets or image filters.

This module contains the following functions:

* ``tsne_2D``:             plots in 2D a set of points using t-SNE.
* ``show_filters``:        plots the filters in a weight matrix.
* ``show_binary_images``:  plots samples from a dataset of images with binary pixels.
* ``show_color_images``:   plots samples from a dataset of images with color pixels.
